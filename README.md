# Cash-Me-Ousside
Finance management application developed during HackFSU '17 by Chad Lim
\nIdea dreamt up by Chad Lim and Kareem Hunte

This application is designed with students and student organizations in mind.
At the moment this application only runs through terminal and simply organizes budgets by name
And distrubtes funds based on user-selected budgets
Users are able to alter their budgets to change how money is distrubted on the fly, and adding funds
  results in the new funds being distrubted throughout the budgeted items based on the percentages
  input by the user.
Users can also subtract funds from a specific section of their budget. Unlike changing the budget percentages,
  changes made to funds by subtracting them does not alter the rest of the user's funds. 
 
In the future this application will have its own GUI and be able to present graphical representations of the
  funds a user has in their account so that they can easily see the status of their funds without having to 
  go into too much detail.
On the focus on student organizations, the final goal of this application is to be a web application that 
  student organiztations can use to quickly and easily keep track of the budgets allocated to them by themselves
  or by student government.
